# sample-size-and-power-calculations-for-vaccine-efficacy-trials
Two methods to power calculations and sample size estimation for vaccine efficacy clinical trials: Exact Conditional under Poisson Assumption and the Z-Test based Normal Approximation, as described by Chan & Bohidar (1998). Their original paper can be referenced for further reading on these two methods, cited below. 

The algorithm used in the Exact Conditional approach, as far as we are aware, is unique to our code here. Otherwise, the code we've presented adheres to all formulas and equations, as presented by Chan & Bohidar (1998). The work performed here was part of a 2018 MS Thesis at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health, Department of Biostatistics.
